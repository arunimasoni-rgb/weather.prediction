Project Title: Weather Prediction Project
Description:
This project uses machine learning to predict weather patterns based on historical data. Built in Google Colab with Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, it includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization of predictions.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing weather datasets for analysis.
Model Training: Implementing machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forests) to forecast weather conditions like temperature, humidity, or precipitation.
Visualization: Generating plots and charts to display predictions and historical trends.
Evaluation: Metrics to assess model accuracy (e.g., RMSE, MAE).
How to Run
Open the .ipynb notebook file in Google Colab (upload it if needed).
Ensure required libraries are installed by running:

Data Sources:
Weather data sourced from public APIs like OpenWeatherMap or datasets from Kaggle (e.g., historical weather records).
